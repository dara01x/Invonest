# Ezoic Ads.txt Redirect Setup - GitHub Pages Solution

## üö® Issue: Ezoic Ads.txt Manager Integration

Ezoic requires a **server-side redirect** from `/ads.txt` to `https://srv.adstxtmanager.com/19390/invonest.me`, but GitHub Pages has limitations with redirects.

## üîß Solutions Implemented

### **Solution 1: Static Ads.txt File** ‚úÖ (Current)
```plaintext
# Located at: public/ads.txt
# Contains basic Ezoic entries for immediate detection
ezoic.com, 19390, DIRECT
google.com, pub-3508869974779106, DIRECT, f08c47fec0942fa0
google.com, pub-8241049497608997, RESELLER, f08c47fec0942fa0
```

### **Solution 2: JavaScript Redirect Handler** ‚úÖ
```typescript
// Located at: src/lib/adsTextRedirect.ts
// Handles client-side redirect for ads.txt requests
initializeAdsTextRedirect();
```

### **Solution 3: Multiple Redirect Files** ‚úÖ
- `public/_redirects` - For Netlify compatibility
- `ads-redirect.md` - Jekyll-style redirect
- `_config.yml` - GitHub Pages configuration

## üéØ Recommended Actions

### **Option A: Keep Current Setup**
The static ads.txt file with basic Ezoic entries should be sufficient for Ezoic to detect your integration. The file contains:
- Your Ezoic publisher ID (19390)
- Your Google AdSense ID
- Required seller authorizations

### **Option B: Contact Ezoic Support**
If Ezoic still can't detect the integration:
1. Mention you're using **GitHub Pages** (static hosting)
2. Provide your ads.txt URL: `https://invonest.me/ads.txt`
3. Request manual verification of your publisher ID: **19390**

### **Option C: Alternative Hosting Solution**
For true server-side redirects, consider:
- **Netlify** (supports `_redirects` file)
- **Vercel** (supports redirects in config)
- **Cloudflare Pages** (supports `_redirects`)

## üìã Current Ads.txt Status

### **Live URL**: `https://invonest.me/ads.txt`
### **Content**:
```plaintext
# Ads.txt file for invonest.me
# Managed by Ezoic Ads.txt Manager
ezoic.com, 19390, DIRECT
google.com, pub-3508869974779106, DIRECT, f08c47fec0942fa0
google.com, pub-8241049497608997, RESELLER, f08c47fec0942fa0
```

## üîç Verification Steps

1. **Visit**: `https://invonest.me/ads.txt`
2. **Verify**: Ezoic entry shows `ezoic.com, 19390, DIRECT`
3. **Confirm**: Your Publisher ID (19390) is present
4. **Check**: Google AdSense entries are included

## üí° Why GitHub Pages is Limited

GitHub Pages is a **static hosting service** that doesn't support:
- Server-side redirects (301/302)
- `.htaccess` files
- Custom server configurations

The current implementation provides the **best possible solution** for GitHub Pages hosting.

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Commit and deploy** the current changes
2. **Wait 24-48 hours** for Ezoic to detect the ads.txt file
3. **Contact Ezoic support** if detection issues persist
4. **Consider alternative hosting** if server-side redirects are absolutely required

## ‚úÖ Alternative: Manual Ezoic Setup

If automated detection fails, you can:
1. **Contact Ezoic support**
2. **Provide your domain**: invonest.me
3. **Provide your publisher ID**: 19390
4. **Request manual ads.txt verification**

The current setup should work for Ezoic's ad serving even without the automatic Ads.txt Manager integration.
